This Flux is an art made by Victor Savkin with using Angular2, RxJS and TypeScript.

(UPDATE)  
Adding "main.without.asyncpipe.ts" which works without AsyncPipe.

--- 

(UPDATE)  
Now you can write async/await.

---

(UPDATE)  
Rewriting "config.js" for dynamic module loading.  
Now you can find a lot of modules are loaded on browser when you kick to run Angular2 by builtin developer tools.
